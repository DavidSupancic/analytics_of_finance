# Financial Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on comprehensive financial data analysis, exploring various aspects of market behavior, economic indicators, and financial modeling. The analysis is implemented in Python, utilizing modern data science libraries and statistical tools.

## Part 1: Market Analysis and Financial Modeling

### 1. Economic Indicators Analysis
- Investigation of relationships between GDP, inflation, and interest rates
- Time series visualization of economic indicators
- Analysis of correlations and interdependencies

### 2. Order Book Analysis
- Sampling and analysis of order book data
- Processing of minute-level and daily-level data
- Market microstructure insights

### 3. Stylized Facts of Logarithmic Returns
- Analysis of logarithmic returns autocorrelation
- Investigation of absolute logarithmic returns autocorrelation
- Heavy-tail distribution analysis of returns

### 4. Return Models Implementation
- ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) modeling
- GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) analysis
- Combined ARMA-GARCH models

### 5. Factor Models
- Single-factor return model (Market factor)
- BARRA model implementation
- Fama-French factor analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Pyplot for visualization
- Seaborn for statistical visualizations
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning implementations
- Statsmodels for statistical modeling
- Arch for GARCH modeling
